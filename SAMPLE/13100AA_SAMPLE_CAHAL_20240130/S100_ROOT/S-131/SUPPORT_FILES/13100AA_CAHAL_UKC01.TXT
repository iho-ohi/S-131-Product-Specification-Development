    Any Terminal or vessel/company specific UKC requirements that are greater than those stated above, shall supersede those in this section. See the Port Sections Guide â€“ Appendix A for further information

(2)  Speed in and out of port must be reduced to a rate that minimizes increase in draft due to squat.
