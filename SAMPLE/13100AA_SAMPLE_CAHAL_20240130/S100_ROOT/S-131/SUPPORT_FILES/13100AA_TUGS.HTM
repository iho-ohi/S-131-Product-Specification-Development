        <h3>TUG MATRIX (CONVENTIONAL VESSELS GREATER THAN (&geq;) 150 METERS LOA)</h3>
        <p>The tug matrix below outlines the minimum number of tugs required for a vessel maneuvering alongside a dock and/or another vessel. Depending on the vessel’s particulars, weather conditions, berth congestion, obstructions
            and/or particular terminal requirements, additional tugs may be requested by the HPA, the master and/or at the pilot’s discretion while maneuvering. It must be emphasized that these are minimum tug requirements.

        <p>Note 1: An obstruction would include a vessel, fixed structure or crane (whether its boom is up or down) on the berth in the direction of departure of the berthed position.</p>
        <p>Note 2: Vessels greater than 150 metres LOA and equipped with “special rudders” and/or “thrusters”, are not required to take tugs unless dictated by the prevailing conditions.</p>
        <p>Subject to all other measures required by the Port Information Guide, vessels maneuvering in the Port of Halifax shall, at the discretion of the Master and in concurrence with the Pilot, elect not to use the services of tug(s). However, under circumstances and conditions relating to environmental protection, the safety of navigation and/or the safety of HPA leased and/or operated facilities or infrastructure, the HPA may require a vessel to secure the services of a tug(s).</p>
        <p>Note 3: There may also be specific tug requirements applicable at other marine facilities within the confines of the port that are not directly operated and/or leased by the HPA.</p>
