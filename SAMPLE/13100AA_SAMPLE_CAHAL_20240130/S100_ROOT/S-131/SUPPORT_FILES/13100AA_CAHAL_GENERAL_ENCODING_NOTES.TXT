1) There are two HarbourAreaAdministrative features, one for the navigable waters within the Port Authority's jurisdiction and a second "overview" feature covering the first plus land areas that are part of the port and related facilities. The second has simplified geometry (rectangle, circle or convex hull - rectangle in the initial version of the sample dataset.)

2) Anchorages A and B are included because they are mentioned in the Port Information Guide prepared by the Halifax Port Authority (HPA). Since the 1.0.0 model requires that AnchorageArea have a componentOf relationship to a HarbourAreaSection, a HarbourAreaSection covering Anchorages A and B is included. The 1.0.0 FC does not require that HarbourAreaSection be associated to a HarbourAreaAdministrative feature but this link is added
